My experience includes developing ETL pipelines that extract data from diverse sources like APIs, websites, and structured files, ensuring seamless data processing and integration.

Currently pursuing my Masterâ€™s in Computer Applications (MCA), I am constantly refining my skills in BigQuery, web scraping, and cloud technologies to drive data-driven solutions. My portfolio includes impactful projects like Travel with Banjara, Hostel Management System, and Car Service Platform, each reflecting my ability to merge technical expertise with user-centric design.
